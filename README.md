# Integra Alarm

Control your Satel Integra alarm via the ETHM-1 module

I've made this code for myself to use, though I hope others may benefit from it as well. I think it now does the basic things.
This code is supported under "I'll see what I can do" principles.
You can download it from GitHub and alter it the way you like it and use it then on your own Homey.

# Integra Alarm

Control your Satel Integra alarm via the ETHM-1 module

Made a beta release of my first pass at connecting my Satel Integra Alarm to my Homey.

In this version the only things implemented are:
1. Connect & recognize the alarm type
2. Only the THEN section flowcards are available (arm/disarm)
3. A polling mechanism, though without any payload to identify state change.
